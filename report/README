Network Test Report
===================

Generates a static page summarizing test results.


Installation
------------

Python libraries in requirements.txt. You can install them with:

    pip install --user -r requirements.txt

(Leave off --user if working in a virtual environment.)


Usage
-----

To run on included example data, run:

    ./build.py ./example_data/*

To see all options, run ./build.py --help


Integration notes
-----------------

The report generator in this directory is self-contained, so you don't need to
run the tests to work on the report.
Example data is included, and should be updated when the data format changes
to make work on the report script easier.

Use the --datadir option to point the script to real data.


Hacking
-------

The input data is in two formats:
- JSON if generated by machine
- YAML if written by hand (it's easier to write, and allows things like
    non-strings as keys)

To change an existing page, modify its file in the templates/ directory.
To add a new page, add a template file and a render() call in build.py.
